# Visual 2D Movement Prototype for Java
Contributors:
- Nadelio (Myself)
- TinyBlueSapling (they taught me how to use keyListener and helped a ton with improving my code, many thanks to them!)

Various notes:
- So this was *really* basic
- This can be improved and maybe changed in the future to have more features, but I am leaving it like this for now
- Swing and AWT are really annoying to work with
- How Tiny and I got this working was really interesting and I learned quite a bit about how keyListener and various graphical classes work!
- Again, huge thanks to Tiny for all the help :)
